Project Title: Social Media Analyzer using LangFlow and DataStax AstraDB

In this project, we developed a Social Media Analyzer, an intuitive and efficient tool designed to extract meaningful insights from social media data across multiple platforms. Leveraging LangFlow for seamless AI workflow orchestration and DataStax AstraDB for scalable and fast data storage, the system processes diverse datasets to deliver actionable analytics.

We integrated the Gemini API to enable dynamic and context-aware analysis based on user prompts. This allows the analyzer to adapt its output to specific queries, such as sentiment analysis, trending topics, or engagement metrics, making it highly versatile and user-centric.

To complement the project, we created a YouTube video that explains the functionality and impact of the analyzer in detail. Check out the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2ztWckklKE

This project showcases the potential of leveraging data-driven insights for informed decision-making, offering a novel approach to understanding the ever-evolving landscape of social media.
